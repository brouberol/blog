I've been running [Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phandelver_and_Below:_The_Shattered_Obelisk) for a while now, and my players have made it to the final chapter, bringing them to [The Far Realm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Far_Realm).

That realm is supposed to be so alien, so paradoxical and so aberrant that it is likely to shatter the PC's minds.

> The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.
> The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen.
> For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles and horror.
>
{{ quotesource("DMG p68") }}

> In short, both gravity and time are absent in the Far Realm, and instead of the normal rules of physics, the Far Realm is composed of an infinite array of translucent layers that seemingly meld into each other. [...]
> Chances are, travelers to the Far Realm will be flummoxed by the placeâ€™s strange geometry, only comprehending bits and pieces of lifeforms and landmasses depending on which layer they stand on.

The question becomes: how you you mechanically represent the warped geometry and physics laws, and make your player feel the inherent paradox that is this place? Lovecraftian descriptions (describing by ommission) only took me so far, and at some point, I needed to give my players _something_ to make them feel this place for real.

I decided to introduce a couple of house rules, called _time changes_, _space changes_ and _reality changes_.

While in combat, time and space will randomly change for each group (PCs and monsters). At initiative 20, each group rolls 2d10, each die representing the time and space changes. I settled on applying effects by group, because having _each_ player and monster roll random effects would have been too chaotic to track, and having the random effects apply to _all_ groups could negate its impact (ex: having both groups double in size is equivalent of having them stay at regular size).

In my experience, these random variations bring enough randommess and chaos to combat to add real flavour, as well as an extra layer of required adaptaton and strategizing from the players' part.

### Space changes

| d10 | Effect |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Your movement speed is multiplied by 2 |
| 2 | Your movement speed is divided by 2 |
| 3 | Your size increases by one |
| 4 | Your size decreases by one |
| 5 | You cannot move |
| 6 | Your attack or spell range is divided by 2 |
| 7 | You teleport to a random location on the map |
| 8 | You plane shift to a random plane for 6s |
| 9 | Gravity shifts: up is down |
| 10 | A [Cloaker Mutate](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#cloaker%20mutate_pabtso) appears and attacks all sides |

### Time changes

| d10 | Effect |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | You lose your bonus action |
| 2 | You gain an extra bonus action |
| 3 | You can either use your action or bonus action |
| 4 | You gain an extra action |
| 5 | You cannot use your reaction |
| 6 | You gain an extra reaction |
| 7 | Return to your previous physical location on the battlemap |
| 8 | You attack first |
| 9 | You attack last |
| 10 | You go back in time. Cancel the damage from the last attack that dealt you damage |


However, the reality changes occur when you _leave_ the Far Realm, or after each full spent day in that dimension. Each player roll their own d20, to see how they are affected by the warping properties of that place.

### Reality changes

| d20 | Effect |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | You gain 1d12 max HP |
| 2 | You lose 1d12 max HP |
| 3 | You permanently lose a random magical item, and gain another one |
| 4 | You can reroll nat 1s once per day |
| 5 | You crit on a 19 and 20 for 1d4 day |
| 6 | You change species. Lose all racial attributes and the ones of the new species. |
| 7 | You learn Eldricht Blast. You have to multiclass to Warlock next level |
| 8 | You increase your max HP by 2 die and permanently lose a failure death save |
| 9 | You learn one cantrip |
| 10 | You forget one cantrip |
| 11 | Your personality splits. You have to multiclass next level |
| 12 | Add +1 and -1 to characteristics of your choice |
| 13 | You learn how to fly but lose 10ft of speed |
| 14 | You learn a new language and forget another one |
| 15 | You can now hold 2 inspirations |
| 16 | Your skin turns to stone. You gain +2 AC but lose 10ft of speed |
| 17 | You gain an extra hit die |
| 18 | You lose a hit die |
| 19 | You change a skill proficiency |
| 20 | You gain +1 AC |

For example, my wife's PC (a Halflin rogue) forgot how to speak Halfling after leaving a pocket universe located in the Far Realm, as well as transformed into a [Water Genasi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Water_genasi) after having spent too much time in the Briny Maze. The mechanical changes induced by that ancestry change (loss of her Halfling luck, new magical abilities, as well as the ability to breathe under water) allowed her to evolve how she roleplayed that character, and brought new ideas to the table.

I hope you try these out, and please reach out with your feedback!
