Title: A French character sheet for Mothership 1E
Date: 2025-09-20
Category: TTRPG
Description: I'm sharing my own French translation of the Mothership 1E character sheet.
Summary: I'm excited to be GM-ing [The Haunting of Ypsilon 14](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/the-haunting-of-ypsilon-14) [Mothership 1E](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg) module for a group of friends in a couple of weeks. I couldn't find a French 1/1 translation of the original character sheet, so I made one. It's [there](https://balthazar-rouberol.com/public/Mothership-Character-Sheet-fr.pdf) if you need it!
