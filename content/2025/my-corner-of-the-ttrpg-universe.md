[TOC]

I've been playing TTRPGs for years, and have grown more and more tired of playing Dungeons and Dragons for a while now. It was a slow trickle of things. One perception check too many, having to explain once again that your CON score does not matter and only your bonus does, the thousandth fireball, or simply having a player wait for their turn to simply miss and accomplish nothing. And then the [OGL controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License#Leaked_OGL1.1_draft) happened. _That_ really did put me off. Strong-arming your own creator community into paying up will never be something I condone. Period. After that whole shebang, I decided to not buy a single new book from WotC when my campaign was over.

2023 was interesting though, because that controversy led to a renewed blooming of the 3rd party ecosystem, and seemingly every TTRPG designer started a Kickstarter for a new game. 2 years later, many of these games are here, people are playing them, streaming them, and discussing them. And as my campaign is closing down, I'm really excited about many of these games.

I've also decided to stop GM-ing year-long campaigns, and focus on 2-6 session adventures, to be able to experience many of these games, and tell more varied stories.

## Games

### Mothership

![mothership](https://spg-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/83afa426-91df-45a2-ad2c-fe5c7a794999)
[Mothership](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/484222/mothership-player-s-survival-guide?affiliate_id=81207) is a sci-fi survival horror game in space. Picture _Alien_, as the xenomorph is picking the crew of the Nostromo one by one. The books are incredibly well-designed: each game aspect is either described in a single page or spread, the system is easy to pick up for newcomers (1d100, roll under), and the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0022/2727/3817/files/Mothership-Character-Sheet.pdf?v=1713672550" target="_blank">character sheet</a> is probably the best I've seen out there. It is both a character sheet and a _flowchart_, walking you through the character creation process. Any newcomer should be able to roll their character in less than 5 minutes (compare that to D&D5e...). And if you like digital tools, you can use the [official app](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-companion-app) to manage your characters. On top of everything, there's an unofficial free [Foundry game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/mosh/).

I'm running [The Hauting of Ypsilon 14](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/products/the-haunting-of-ypsilon-14) in a couple of weeks, and I couldn't be more excited. I remixed resources and ideas from [TRAAASH](https://www.traaa.sh/the-ypsilon-14-terminal) and [Chris Airiau](https://chrisairiau.com/2022/05/22/off-the-ice-ypsilon-14-part-1/) as well as [`redhg/phosphor`](https://github.com/redhg/phosphor/) to produce this [retrofuturistic computer](https://balthazar-rouberol.com/ypsilon14) for my players to interact with.

The one criticism I have before having played the game is that the combat system is a little vague when it comes to how the monster acts. After having read a couple of things online, I gathered that you're supposed to telegraph the monster action to your players, and they tell you what they're doing about it. The monster action is assumed to automatically succeed, except if the player counter-action is itself successful.

I'm planning to implement the Monster Action table from [Domain of Many Things](https://www.domainofmanythings.com/blog/combat-in-mothership-rpg-really-doesnt-have-to-be-complicated) (itself taken from [Alien - The Roleplaying game](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/alien/)) and steal and adapt their monster decision table to add impredictibility to how the monster behaves.

I was so enthused at the idea of playing Mothership that I also bought [Hull Breach](https://www.hullbreachrpg.com/), an anthology of adventures and additional content.

### Pirate Borg

![pirate borg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/603fdb9fada6165d919a6543/1650649068563-X7EAXW0IDR77Y4ZK2J99/Pirate+Borg+Banner+16x9.jpg?format=1500w&content-type=image%2Fjpeg)

[Pirate Borg](https://www.limithron.com/pirateborg) is a [Mörk Borg](https://morkborg.com/) hack in the universe of the Dark Carribbean. The vibe is Pirates of the Carribean mixed with [Black Sails](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sails_(TV_series)>), where you can consume a drug made of crushed undead bones and cast spells. The book art is really vivid, in-your-face, and thematic. I can't wait to have my players build their crazy scallywags, smugglers and swashbucklers, to have them fight zombies and sea creatures; their ship assaulted by the crew of _The Dishonorable Eel_ while everyone at the table drinks rum when their attack misses.

One thing I struggled with a bit was the layout and font of the rules page, as impactful as they are, can hinder the absorption of the rules at first reading. The same can be said about Mörk Borg, so I'm guessing Luke Stratton went for the same style. Adventures don't suffer from that issue: the layout is compact and clear, and you have everything you need in a single spread.

This [character generator](https://pirateborg.brettodonnell.ca/) might prove very handy, as might this [Foundry game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pirateborg).

### Daggerheart

![daggheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Daggerheaert-Core-Mat-Wilma-1_small.jpg)
You might have heard about this small indie series called Critical Role? [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/) is the game they released this year. It's a narrative and strategic game that both heavily inspired by [PbtA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) games, as well as D&D4e. The book itself is incredibly well done, with a legible layout and vibrant colors. Each power and ability gets its own card (and you know how much [I love cards](https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/my-dungeon-master-toolkit#spell-cards)).

What I'm the most excited about with Daggerheart is the Fear/Hope system, where each action can succeed or fail _with consequences or opportunities_. I've missed this gradient of outcomes in D&D5e, where actions simply succeed or fail. There's really _a lot_ to like about this game. It feels like D&D, with more strategic monsters, less complicated classes, and real mechanics to reinforce the narration (character past experiences giving you a bonus when they apply, the flow of fear and hope between the GM and the players building up tension, ...).

I also like the concept of [campaign frames](https://daggerheart.su/frame), which are some kind of mini campaign setting, "pitching" us a particular world, as well as the tone of the story we could/should tell in that frame and the associated specific mechanics.

If you're interested in a deep (and I do mean _deep_) analysis of the game, I've compiled a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IFgrehqr4&list=PLTQxkMEgROoG4P7lny963mUMbePFtzZJm&pp=gAQB) of streams by Derik Malinda from The [Knights of Last Call](https://www.youtube.com/@KnightsofLastCall) disecting the book from cover to cover. Beware, there's about 68h of video in there.

This is a _large_ game though, and I'm unlikely to be GM-ing anytime soon. I'm however going to play in a one shot though, based in the [Colossus of the Drylands](https://daggerheart.su/frame/colossus-of-the-drylands) campaign frame!

### Shadowdark

![shadowdark](https://www.azathought.com/assets/img/posts/2024-08-31-shadowdark3.jpg)

Shadowdark is basically my go-to game for new players who want to learn "D&D". It's very rules-light compared to 5e, making it pretty accessible for newcomers, and even more so if you're already familiar with 5e. You get all the traditional stuff: the d20 system, advantage/disadvantage, etc, but the mechanics have been streamlined to the essential. No skill checks, no spell slots, much fewer spells, no feats, etc. The [character sheet](https://imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com/img/document/617822983/original/b465a1ea02/1689281843?v=1) speaks for itself when it comes to how simple the game is.

The game might be rule-simple, but it is also dark, fast, stressful and brutal. There's a real-time aspect to the game, as torches are rare and run out after an hour of gane time. It's basically a mix of modern and OG D&D, distilled to its essential form. I've run a one shot, [Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/products/shadowdark-rpg-quickstart-set) with a group of new players, and they really seemed to have a blast.

I've used that official [character generator](https://shadowdarklings.net/create) to create a bunch of pre-gens for them to choose from, and we used the [community Foundry game system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/shadowdark). If you're thinking about playing Shadowdark in a VTT, I suggest using the tokens designed by [You See This](https://youseethis.blog/tokens/) (I actually support him on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/YouSeeThis)). They integrate wonderfully with the game's B/W art direction and the whole [OSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance) vibe.

### Dune - Adventures in the Imperium

![dune rpg](https://www.wargamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dune-rpg-adventures-in-the-imperium-interview-11.jpg)

This one is a bit of a pipe dream. I know I'd _love_ to play it, but I'm bad at running political intrigues, and none of my regular players are Dune-heads. That being, said, the game is _beautiful_. It's using the [2d20 system](https://modiphius.net/blogs/news/2d20-basics) from [Modiphius](https://modiphius.net/), where any success earn you some meta-currency called _Momentum_, that will help you down the line. You can succeed by giving _Threat_ to the GM, that they can then use down the road to raise the stakes.
The Momentum/Threat meta-currency duality reminds me of the Fear/Hope system in Daggerheart. After having watched [Inherit the Sand](https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/shows/inherit-the-sand), I can attest that they work really well at reinforcing tension in a situation.

I'm particularly impressed by the confrontation system, that uses the same fundamental rules to run a close combat, a building escape, up to a ranged spaceship fight.

I hope to try this one out some day!

## Youtube channels

TTRPG influencers are now all over Youtube, after Matt Colville paved the way with his [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) series. Here are my favourites, along with why you might (or might not) want to follow them. Note that I tend to favour long videos.

### Roll for Combat

![rfc](https://battlezoo.com/cdn/shop/files/RFC_Logo_flat.png?v=1646150388)

[Roll For Combat](https://www.youtube.com/@RollForCombat/videos?view=2&sort=dd&live_view=503&shelf_id=4) is a 2-person studio who somehow [published](https://battlezoo.com) a good 15 books in a couple of years. They constantly run multiple simultaneous Kickstarter campaigns, and publish for Pathfinder 2e, D&D5e as well as Shadowdark. The studio is composed of Stephen Glicker, publisher and do-it-all extraordinaire, as well as Mark Seifter, co-creator of Pathfinder 2e. They initially broke the OGL controversy story. They stream every Wednesday, for about 2h, and talk about game design, the TTRPG industry itself, how it shifts and reacts to the political madness of the day, and often feature guests as well. I've learned as much about TTRPGs and their industry than design, business or 80's movies listening to these folks talk.

### Knights of Last Call

![kolc](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/campaign/7049094/5ce5b372fd1a4d29bf1aa7409fd64eb7/eyJ3IjoxNjAwLCJ3ZSI6MX0%3D/1.png?token-hash=pacxu1vCVAREp1kjO6qXpa1otS5WS-OrCt4wLOkJ0SU%3D&token-time=1759536000)
[Knights of Last Call](https://www.youtube.com/@KnightsofLastCall/videos?view=2&sort=dd&live_view=503&shelf_id=2) is run by Derik Malinda, who regularly analyzes TTPRGs in absurdly long streams (5h+ is pretty common nowadays). Derik is a _trove_ of knowledge when it comes to the hobby, and has recently taken <s>a liking</s> an obsession to Daggerheart, and has analyzed it down to its very core. He has recently started to run this channel professionally and is working on a Daggerheart actual play, which I'm very excited about!

### JP Coovert

![jpc](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/campaign/2727391/bdcedfa2291c41529de2c932bbc94a22/eyJ3IjoxNjAwLCJ3ZSI6MX0%3D/2.jpg?token-hash=PpE17XH8xScJnqX8KTpPnayMU2aXauwJvT9O33ecT8o%3D&token-time=1759536000)

Everything [JP Coovert](https://www.youtube.com/@JPCoovert) puts out has this "super-stoked" (has he puts it) vibe. He regularly publishes short DIY drawing or crafting tutorials. Everytime I watch some of his videos, I find myself in a better mood that I was in starting in, and inspired about learning how to draw. JP is my inspiration firestarter.

## Actual Plays

I find Actual Plays to be one of my favourite types of media, when done right. There's freedom, cinematography, tension, madness, improvisation, emotion, laughter.. It's all in there! Good actual plays also give me a _lot_ of inspiration for my own games, and are a good way to absorb new systems.

### Mystery Quest

![mysteryquest](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/4/patreon-media/p/campaign/10987172/c6a0abaddf9a4fb98b5f4f71b1f14d2c/eyJ3IjoxNjAwLCJ3ZSI6MX0%3D/1.png?token-hash=I2E7o-xJ9Fanx0u-ENT-I21r0J30VIA8CVEHj4Zl064%3D&token-time=1759536000)

[Mystery Quest](https://www.youtube.com/@Mystery_Quest/playlists) is probably my favourite discovery of the year, and I'm not mincing my words. They stream 4-6 episode adventures in multiple systems, such as [Pirate Borg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkv3hTQBhiM&list=PLhFDcFS50Ins4uyZ19xyVSTIgYJaVCWJN), [Alien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pSkLRtlIg&list=PLhFDcFS50InuehhDPPineYQK26iuC7X3D) or [Mothership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh2dU7jDnMs&list=PLhFDcFS50InuuaSUQG9qahs8V1EpNuldc). I laughed so hard listening to their [Goblin Grinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLjRoqXWFl8&list=PLhFDcFS50InumJ32EMUuvZANeM3XRYLRV) Mörk Borg adventure that I woke my wife up multiple times on the same night, shaking uncontrolably. She was not pleased.

### Inherit the Sand

![inherit the sand](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/hb93xpxy/production/b9bf44eebb2a16e4801cec7c6f5e9ae954f5bf2c-2667x1500.jpg?rect=0,50,2667,1400&w=1200&h=630)

That [10-episode Dune - Adventures in the Imperium AP](https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/shows/inherit-the-sand) embodies to me what a Dune Actual Play done right should be. Everyone around the table understands the universe they play in, they lean into the drama, the political intrigues and the backstabbing.

This story actually takes place in 2 parts, with 2 different GMs. If you're pressed for time, I'd recommend focusing on the first one. Troy Lavallee GM style was a true masterclass.

### Age of Umbra

![umbra](<https://imagedelivery.net/_18WuG-hYMyVquF6KgU_xQ/critrole-beacon-staging-backend/age_of_umbra_keyart_1920x1080%20(1)-1920x1080.png/format=auto,width=1200>)
I've really enjoyed watching [Age of Umbra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuqL0kYwvSQ&list=PL1tiwbzkOjQyLAwOfoBe6HjYZMnQbXNaZ), a Critical Role actual play set in the Daggerheart homonymous campaign frame, written by Matt Mercer. Picture a Dark Souls world, in which a band of adventurers cling to the faintest hope and go through harrowing hardships to help their community survive another day.

It's a good way to soak in the Daggerhart rules if you don't have 68h to listen to the [Knights of Last Call Daggerweek playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IFgrehqr4&list=PLTQxkMEgROoG4P7lny963mUMbePFtzZJm&pp=gAQB), although still very much in the famous Matt Mercer style.

### Haunting of Hanashira
![hanashira](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8erD6qhexBI/maxresdefault.jpg)

[The Hauting of Hanashira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8erD6qhexBI&list=PL7m14mvokus1obSEHJSug55NPzMjvheha) is a 6 episode (plus episode 0) Daggerheart actual play, taking place in a custom campaign setting inspired by Korean folklore and industrial horror. Their Youtube channel does not seem very well known, but I really enjoyed the narration style, the spirit world / modern world duality, and the overall tone of the story. The players really leaned into the co-creation of the world, and their choices had a true impact on the story. What I liked the most was the fact that Andrew (the GM) was able to improvise real situational complications and opportunities when the players rolled with fear or hope, which had an impact on the course of the scene.
